      <h1>How to Play Trivia Party</h1>
      <p>Welcome to the complete guide for Trivia Party! Whether you're a first-time player or looking to improve your strategy, this guide covers everything you need to know.</p>

      <h2>Game Overview</h2>
      <p><strong>Trivia Party</strong> is a real-time multiplayer trivia game where players compete against each other by answering multiple-choice questions. The game combines knowledge with speed—not only must you answer correctly, but answering quickly earns you bonus points.</p>

      <h2>Quick Start Guide</h2>
      
      <div class="step-box">
        <h4>Step 1: Enter Your Username</h4>
        <p>On the main screen, enter a username (up to 20 characters). This is how other players will see you during the game. Choose something memorable but keep it appropriate for all audiences.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="step-box">
        <h4>Step 2: Create or Join a Room</h4>
        <p><strong>To Create:</strong> Click "Create Room" to start a new game. You'll receive a unique 6-digit room code to share with others.</p>
        <p><strong>To Join:</strong> Click "Join Room," enter the 6-digit code from your friend, and enter the game session.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="step-box">
        <h4>Step 3: Configure Game Settings (Host Only)</h4>
        <p>If you created the room, you can customize:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Number of Rounds:</strong> Choose 3, 5, 10, 15, or 25 questions</li>
          <li><strong>Category:</strong> Select "Mixed Categories" or pick a specific category (Science, History, Geography, Sports, Entertainment)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Then click "Start Game" when all players are ready.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="step-box">
        <h4>Step 4: Play and Answer Questions</h4>
        <p>Once the game starts, all players see the same question and four answer choices simultaneously. Click your answer to submit it—you cannot change your answer once submitted.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="step-box">
        <h4>Step 5: View Results</h4>
        <p>After all rounds are complete, the final leaderboard displays the rankings and scores. The player with the highest score wins!</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Gameplay Mechanics</h2>

      <h3>Questions & Answers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Format:</strong> Each question is multiple-choice with 4 possible answers</li>
        <li><strong>Simultaneous Presentation:</strong> All players see the exact same question at the exact same time</li>
        <li><strong>Equal Opportunity:</strong> No player has an advantage in answering questions</li>
        <li><strong>No Penalties:</strong> Wrong answers don't subtract points; only correct answers earn points</li>
        <li><strong>One Submission:</strong> You can only submit one answer per question—no changes allowed</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Real-Time Competition</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Live Leaderboard:</strong> The leaderboard updates after each question showing current standings</li>
        <li><strong>Score Changes:</strong> Watch your position fluctuate as each new question is answered</li>
        <li><strong>Tension & Excitement:</strong> Lead changes add drama and excitement to every game</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Scoring System</h2>
      <p>Trivia Party uses a unique scoring system that rewards both knowledge and speed:</p>

      <table class="scoring-table">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Condition</th>
            <th>Points Awarded</th>
            <th>Details</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Correct Answer (Fastest)</strong></td>
            <td>1000 points</td>
            <td>Answered correctly within the fastest time bracket</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Correct Answer (Medium Speed)</strong></td>
            <td>800 points</td>
            <td>Answered correctly in medium time</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Correct Answer (Slower)</strong></td>
            <td>600 points</td>
            <td>Answered correctly but took more time</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Wrong Answer</strong></td>
            <td>0 points</td>
            <td>No penalty, just no points awarded</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>No Answer (Timeout)</strong></td>
            <td>0 points</td>
            <td>Question time expired before submission</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h3>How Speed Bonus Works</h3>
      <p>Your answer submission time is tracked from when the question appears. The faster you answer correctly, the more bonus points you earn. This creates an exciting dynamic where being quick AND accurate is rewarded.</p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>How much time do I have to answer each question?</h3>
      <p>Typically, 15-20 seconds per question, though this may vary. The timer appears on the question screen.</p>

      <h3>What happens if I don't answer?</h3>
      <p>If you don't submit an answer before time runs out, it counts as unanswered and you receive 0 points for that question.</p>

      <h3>Can I change my answer after submitting?</h3>
      <p>No. Once you submit an answer, it's locked in. Choose carefully!</p>

      <h3>Is there a time limit to join a room?</h3>
      <p>Players can join a room before the game starts. Once the host starts the game, latecomers cannot join that round.</p>

      <h3>What if someone disconnects during a game?</h3>
      <p>The game continues. That player's scores freeze at their last submitted answer and don't accumulate more points.</p>

      <h3>Can questions repeat in multiple games?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Our question database is extensive, but repetition can occur, especially if you play many games.</p>

      <h3>Is Trivia Party available on mobile?</h3>
